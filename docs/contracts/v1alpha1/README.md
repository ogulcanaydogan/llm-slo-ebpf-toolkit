# v1alpha1 Contracts

This folder contains internal pre-GA schemas used for v0.2 implementation.

## Files
- `probe-event.schema.json`: normalized eBPF probe event payload (`ProbeEventV1`).

## Compatibility Notes
- External compatibility guarantees remain anchored to `docs/contracts/v1/*`.
- `v1alpha1` contracts may evolve until promoted to stable `v1`.
