# Weekly Benchmark and Quality Report (2026-02-17)

## Scope
- Initial collector + attribution baseline.
- Week-4 skeleton benchmark artifact generation.

## Test Summary
- `go test ./...`: pass
- `go run ./cmd/collector`: pass (schema-valid JSONL output)
- `go run ./cmd/attributor`: pass (schema-valid attribution output)
- `go run ./cmd/benchgen`: pass (artifacts generated)

## Benchmark Snapshot
- Scenario: `provider_throttle`
- Workload profile: `rag_mixed`
- Output path: `artifacts/benchmarks`
- Generated artifacts:
  - `attribution_summary.json`
  - `confusion-matrix.csv`
  - `metrics/incident_predictions.csv`

## Benchmark Delta
- Prior week: none (first baseline).
- Current week: baseline established; next iteration will include multi-fault scenarios and overhead trend comparisons.

## Known Limitations
- Current collector pipeline uses synthetic input stream; kernel event ingestion is not yet implemented.
- Attribution is rule-based and tuned for single-fault cases.
- Overhead metrics are baseline placeholders until full runtime probes are integrated.
