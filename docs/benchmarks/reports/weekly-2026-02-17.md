# Weekly Benchmark and Quality Report (2026-02-17)

## Scope
- Initial collector + attribution baseline.
- Week-4 attribution pipeline and contract-aligned benchmark artifact generation.

## Test Summary
- `go test ./...`: pass
- `go run ./cmd/collector`: pass (schema-valid JSONL output)
- `go run ./cmd/attributor --out <file> --summary-out <file> --confusion-out <file>`: pass
- `go run ./cmd/benchgen`: pass (artifacts generated)

## Benchmark Snapshot
- Scenario: `provider_throttle`
- Workload profile: `rag_mixed`
- Output path: `artifacts/benchmarks`
- Generated artifacts:
  - `attribution_summary.json`
  - `confusion-matrix.csv`
  - `incident_predictions.csv`
  - `collector_overhead.csv`
  - `provenance.json`

## Benchmark Delta
- Prior week: benchmark harness with placeholder metrics outputs.
- Current week: attribution pipeline now powers confusion matrix + accuracy metrics from sample streams.

## Known Limitations
- Current collector pipeline uses synthetic input stream; kernel event ingestion is not yet implemented.
- Attribution is rule-based and tuned for single-fault cases.
- `golangci-lint` is configured in CI but not available in the current local environment.
