# v0.2.0 Release Notes

Release date: 2026-02-19

## Overview

v0.2.0 is the first general availability release of the eBPF + LLM Inference SLO Toolkit. It delivers kernel-level observability for LLM inference workloads through 6 CO-RE eBPF probes, a 4-tier correlation engine, a reproducible incident lab, and automated release quality gates.

This release follows a 3-RC burn-in cycle (rc.1–rc.3) with all go-no-go gates passing or enforced.

## Highlights

### eBPF Signal Collection (M2)
- 6 CO-RE eBPF probes: DNS latency, TCP retransmit, runqueue delay, connect latency, TLS handshake, CPU steal.
- Shared ring buffer event format (`llm_slo_event`) with Go consumer for kernel-to-userspace signal flow.
- Probe manager with per-signal lifecycle control, overhead guard, rate limiter, and graceful degradation.
- BCC fallback mode for environments without BTF (DNS + TCP retransmit only, flagged as `bcc_degraded`).

### Correlation Engine (M3)
- 4-tier confidence model: `trace_id_exact` (1.0), `pod_pid_100ms` (0.9), `pod_conn_250ms` (0.8), `svc_node_500ms` (0.65).
- Enrichment threshold at 0.70 — low-confidence events tracked in debug counters only.
- Max join fanout 1:3 to prevent correlation storms.
- Retry storm detector with sliding-window burst detection per pod.
- Retrieval latency decomposition: DNS + connect + TLS mapped to `llm.ebpf.retrieval.kernel_attributed_ms`.
- Correlation quality gate: P=1.00, R=1.00 on 55 labeled pairs across all tiers.

### Incident Lab (M4)
- 6 deterministic fault scenarios: `dns_latency`, `cpu_throttle`, `provider_throttle`, `memory_pressure`, `network_partition`, `mixed`.
- Declarative scenario YAML definitions under `test/incident-lab/scenarios/`.
- Optional real injectors (DNS delay via `tc netem`, retransmit/loss, CPU stress via `stress-ng`) alongside synthetic fallback.
- Prometheus alerting rules: TTFT budget burn, error rate, correlation degraded, agent heartbeat stale, overhead high.

### Benchmark and Release Gates (M5)
- M5 gate tool (`cmd/m5gate`) enforcing B5 (overhead <=3%), D3 (rerun variance <=10%), E3 (Mann-Whitney + bootstrap CI + Cliff's delta).
- Weekly benchmark workflow: 6 scenarios x 3 reruns with baseline comparison and M5 gate execution.
- Release pipeline: cross-compiled binaries (linux-amd64, darwin-arm64), SHA-256 checksums, SBOM (syft), provenance.

### Observability Stack (M1)
- OTel collector, Prometheus, Tempo, Grafana deployed via kustomize.
- 17 Grafana panels across 3 dashboards (SLO Overview, Kernel Correlation, Incident Lab).
- RAG demo service with TTFT, tokens/sec, and trace_id telemetry.
- OTLP/HTTP log exporter for SLO and probe events.

### Container Images
- `ghcr.io/ogulcanaydogan/llm-slo-ebpf-toolkit-agent` — eBPF agent DaemonSet image.
- `ghcr.io/ogulcanaydogan/llm-slo-ebpf-toolkit-rag-service` — RAG demo service image.
- Keyless cosign signing and provenance attestations via GitHub Actions OIDC.

### Security and Deployment
- Min-capability deployment overlay (`deploy/k8s/min-capability`) dropping `privileged: true` in favor of `CAP_BPF + CAP_SYS_ADMIN + CAP_SYS_RESOURCE`.
- Security documentation at `docs/security/agent-min-capability-mode.md`.
- Kernel compatibility matrix with multi-profile runner probing.

### Infrastructure
- AWS ephemeral eBPF runner: t3a.xlarge, 80GB encrypted gp3, SSM-managed, HTTPS-only egress.
- Runner preflight detection with automatic synthetic fallback in CI.
- E2E evidence report workflow for deterministic audit bundles.

## Go/No-Go Summary

All gates PASS or ENFORCED. See `docs/strategy/v0.2-go-no-go-checklist.md` for the full matrix.

| Section | Gates | Status |

## Changes Since RC

- Container image publishing to GHCR with cosign signing and provenance attestations.
- E2E evidence report workflow for auditable test bundles.
- Min-capability non-privileged deployment overlay with security documentation.
- Real chaos injectors (DNS delay, retransmit/loss, CPU stress) alongside synthetic fallback.
- Kernel compatibility matrix workflow and compatibility document.
- Stabilized nightly integration, hardened OTLP smoke, host-network DNS fix, kind startup retries.

## Binaries

| Binary | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `agent` | eBPF agent DaemonSet |
| `collector` | SLO event collector |
| `attributor` | Incident attribution engine |
| `benchgen` | Benchmark artifact generator |
| `faultreplay` | Multi-domain fault replay |
| `faultinject` | Synthetic fault injection |
| `correlationeval` | Correlation quality evaluator |
| `m5gate` | M5 GA gate enforcement |
| `sloctl` | CLI toolkit |
| `loadgen` | Load generator |

## Known Limitations

- eBPF probe integration tests require a Linux host with BTF; macOS/Windows CI runs use synthetic fallback.
- Attribution is rule-based and tuned for low-cardinality scenarios.
- Min-capability mode reduces signal set to DNS + TCP retransmit only.
