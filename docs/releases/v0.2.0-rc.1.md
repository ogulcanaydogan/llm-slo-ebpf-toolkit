# v0.2.0-rc.1 Release Notes

Release date: 2026-02-18

## Highlights

This is the first release candidate for v0.2.0, marking the completion of all six planned milestones (M0–M5). Every go-no-go gate is PASS or ENFORCED.

### eBPF Signal Collection (M2)
- 6 CO-RE eBPF probes: DNS latency, TCP retransmit, runqueue delay, connect latency, TLS handshake, CPU steal.
- Shared ring buffer event format (`llm_slo_event`) with Go consumer for kernel-to-userspace signal flow.
- Probe manager with per-signal lifecycle control, safety integration (overhead guard + rate limiter), and graceful degradation.
- BCC fallback mode for environments without BTF (DNS + TCP retransmit only, flagged as `bcc_degraded`).

### Correlation Engine (M3)
- 4-tier confidence model: `trace_id_exact` (1.0), `pod_pid_100ms` (0.9), `pod_conn_250ms` (0.8), `svc_node_500ms` (0.65).
- Enrichment threshold at 0.70 — low-confidence events tracked in debug counters only.
- Max join fanout 1:3 to prevent correlation storms.
- Retry storm detector with sliding-window burst detection per pod.
- Retrieval latency decomposition: DNS + connect + TLS mapped to `llm.ebpf.retrieval.kernel_attributed_ms`.
- Correlation quality gate: P=1.00, R=1.00 on 55 labeled pairs across all tiers.

### Incident Lab (M4)
- 6 deterministic fault scenarios: `dns_latency`, `cpu_throttle`, `provider_throttle`, `memory_pressure`, `network_partition`, `mixed`.
- Declarative scenario YAML definitions under `test/incident-lab/scenarios/`.
- Prometheus alerting rules: TTFT budget burn, error rate, correlation degraded, agent heartbeat stale, overhead high.

### Benchmark and Release Gates (M5)
- M5 gate tool (`cmd/m5gate`) enforcing B5 (overhead <=3%), D3 (rerun variance <=10%), E3 (Mann-Whitney + bootstrap CI + Cliff's delta).
- Weekly benchmark workflow: 6 scenarios x 3 reruns with baseline comparison and M5 gate execution.
- Release pipeline: cross-compiled binaries (linux-amd64, darwin-arm64), SHA-256 checksums, SBOM (syft), provenance.

### Observability Stack (M1)
- OTel collector, Prometheus, Tempo, Grafana deployed via kustomize.
- 17 Grafana panels across 3 dashboards (SLO Overview, Kernel Correlation, Incident Lab).
- RAG demo service with TTFT, tokens/sec, and trace_id telemetry.

### Infrastructure
- AWS ephemeral eBPF runner: t3a.xlarge, 80GB encrypted gp3, SSM-managed, HTTPS-only egress.
- Runner preflight detection with automatic synthetic fallback in CI.

## Go/No-Go Summary

All gates PASS or ENFORCED. See `docs/strategy/v0.2-go-no-go-checklist.md` for the full matrix.

| Section | Gates | Status |
|---------|-------|--------|
| A. Contract/API | A1–A4 | All PASS |
| B. Signal/Runtime | B1–B4 PASS, B5 ENFORCED | All PASS/ENFORCED |
| C. Correlation | C1–C5 | All PASS |
| D. Reproducibility | D1–D2 PASS, D3 ENFORCED, D4 PASS | All PASS/ENFORCED |
| E. Statistics | E1–E2 PASS, E3 ENFORCED, E4 PASS | All PASS/ENFORCED |
| F. CI/CD/Security | F1–F5 | All PASS |

## Known Limitations

- Fault injection and replay are synthetic (not kernel-level injectors); suitable for attribution benchmarks but not for live chaos testing.
- Container image (`ghcr.io/ogulcanaydogan/llm-slo-ebpf-toolkit-agent`) is built per-CI but not published to a registry in this RC.
- eBPF probe integration tests require a Linux host with BTF; macOS/Windows CI runs use synthetic fallback only.
- Attribution is rule-based and tuned for low-cardinality scenarios.

## RC Burn-In Plan

- Run weekly benchmark workflow 2–3 times during RC period.
- Monitor self-hosted runner stability for 7+ days.
- Validate M5 gates pass consistently (B5 overhead, D3 variance, E3 significance).
- GA cut after successful burn-in with no regressions.
