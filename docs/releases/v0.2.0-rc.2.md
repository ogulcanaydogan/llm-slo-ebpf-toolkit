# v0.2.0-rc.2 Release Notes

Release date: 2026-02-19

## Summary

This release candidate focuses on CI stabilization and merge-gate hardening after `v0.2.0-rc.1`. The objective is to keep privileged eBPF validation reliable and enforceable before GA.

## Highlights

### Nightly Privileged Path Stabilization
- Fixed OTLP/observability path regressions by using metric-driven smoke assertions instead of brittle collector debug-log text matching.
- Fixed agent runtime schema path and command path in containerized execution (`/app` workdir, contracts copied into image).
- Fixed host-network DNS resolution for the agent DaemonSet with `dnsPolicy: ClusterFirstWithHostNet`.
- Fixed RAG smoke rollout wait behavior to avoid false failures caused by terminating old pods during deployment updates.

### PR Merge Gate Hardening
- Added `.github/workflows/pr-privileged-ebpf-smoke.yml`.
- New workflow executes:
  - runner preflight (`self-hosted+linux+ebpf` detection),
  - kind deploy baseline,
  - OTLP observability smoke,
  - RAG demo smoke,
  - privileged eBPF smoke.
- Trusted same-repo pull requests require privileged runner availability; fork PRs intentionally skip privileged execution.

### Existing Evidence-Grade Paths (Retained)
- Hello tracer + real probe metrics:
  - `llm_ebpf_hello_syscalls_total`
  - `llm_ebpf_dns_latency_ms_bucket`
  - `llm_ebpf_probe_events_total`
- Evidence dashboard and alert remain active:
  - `dashboards/evidence-e2e.json`
  - `LLMHighTTFTWithDNSKernelSignal`
- Optional real backend path (`llama_cpp`) remains supported in demo service.
- AWS ephemeral runner IaC remains in `infra/runner/aws`.

## Validation Snapshot

- Nightly privileged workflow success on patched branch (`privileged-kind-integration` green, fallback skipped).
- Weekly benchmark workflow success with `full-benchmark-matrix` and M5 GA gates green.

## Known Limitations

- Privileged eBPF integration still depends on self-hosted Linux runner availability.
- Release workflow publishes binaries and supply-chain artifacts but does not yet publish container images to registry as part of tag pipeline.
- Synthetic fallback paths remain in scheduled workflows for resilience when runners are unavailable.
