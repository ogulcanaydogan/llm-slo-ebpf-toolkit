# v0.2 Go/No-Go Checklist

Use this checklist at RC cut and GA cut.  
Decision rule: any blocking gate marked `FAIL` is a `NO-GO`.

## A. Contract and API Gates

| Gate | Pass Criteria | Blocker |
|---|---|---|
| A1 v1 contract compatibility | No breaking changes in `docs/contracts/v1/*` | Yes |
| A2 v1alpha1 probe schema | `docs/contracts/v1alpha1/probe-event.schema.json` present and validated | Yes |
| A3 config schema structure | `config/toolkit.schema.json` uses nested required fields (not dotted pseudo-keys) | Yes |
| A4 semconv consistency | Required `llm.ebpf.*` and `llm.slo.*` keys defined and used consistently | Yes |

## B. Signal and Runtime Gates

| Gate | Pass Criteria | Blocker |
|---|---|---|
| B1 CO-RE signal coverage | 6/6 required signals pass on reference kernels | Yes |
| B2 fallback capability flagging | BCC mode reports degraded capability explicitly | Yes |
| B3 runtime safety controls | per-signal toggles, rate limiter, degrade mode verified | Yes |
| B4 overhead dev gate | <=5% CPU overhead during development builds | Yes for RC |
| B5 overhead GA gate | <=3% CPU overhead at GA candidate | Yes for GA |

## C. Correlation Quality Gates

| Gate | Pass Criteria | Blocker |
|---|---|---|
| C1 join precedence | Confidence tiers implemented exactly as plan | Yes |
| C2 enrichment threshold | Span enrichment only when confidence >=0.7 | Yes |
| C3 debug-only low confidence | 0.65 tier events exported only for diagnostics | Yes |
| C4 accuracy gate | Precision >=0.90 and Recall >=0.85 on labeled integration set | Yes |
| C5 fanout control | Max join fanout 1:3 enforced | Yes |

## D. Incident and Reproducibility Gates

| Gate | Pass Criteria | Blocker |
|---|---|---|
| D1 deterministic harness | seed/load profile/phase defaults reproducible | Yes |
| D2 scenario coverage | 6 required scenarios implemented with pass/fail assertions | Yes |
| D3 rerun variance | <=10% variance across three reruns per scenario | Yes |
| D4 required artifact bundle | `summary.md`, `attribution_summary.json`, `incident_predictions.csv`, `collector_overhead.csv`, `provenance.json` | Yes |

## E. Benchmark and Statistics Gates

| Gate | Pass Criteria | Blocker |
|---|---|---|
| E1 minimum repetitions | >=10 runs/profile for release-claim metrics | Yes |
| E2 CI reporting | CI95 and class balance published in report | Yes |
| E3 significance rule | Mann-Whitney/bootstrap gate configured and enforced | Yes |
| E4 baseline selection | previous stable tag used, else first GA anchor fallback | Yes |

## F. CI/CD and Security Gates

| Gate | Pass Criteria | Blocker |
|---|---|---|
| F1 PR CI | build/lint/unit/schema checks all green | Yes |
| F2 nightly Linux integration | privileged smoke suite green (DNS/retransmit/CPU) | Yes |
| F3 weekly full benchmark | tag matrix and full incident matrix complete | Yes |
| F4 runner isolation | ephemeral privileged runners and isolated node pool | Yes |
| F5 supply-chain release | signed artifacts, SBOM, checksums, provenance | Yes |
