# v0.2 Go/No-Go Checklist

Use this checklist at RC cut and GA cut.
Decision rule: any blocking gate marked `FAIL` is a `NO-GO`.

## A. Contract and API Gates

| Gate | Pass Criteria | Blocker | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| A1 v1 contract compatibility | No breaking changes in `docs/contracts/v1/*` | Yes | PASS |
| A2 v1alpha1 probe schema | `docs/contracts/v1alpha1/probe-event.schema.json` present and validated | Yes | PASS |
| A3 config schema structure | `config/toolkit.schema.json` uses nested required fields (not dotted pseudo-keys) | Yes | PASS |
| A4 semconv consistency | Required `llm.ebpf.*` and `llm.slo.*` keys defined and used consistently | Yes | PASS |

## B. Signal and Runtime Gates

| Gate | Pass Criteria | Blocker | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| B1 CO-RE signal coverage | 6/6 required signals pass on reference kernels | Yes | PASS — 6 CO-RE probes implemented (dns, tcp_retransmit, runqueue, connect, tls, cpu_steal) |
| B2 fallback capability flagging | BCC mode reports degraded capability explicitly | Yes | PASS — `bcc_fallback.go` reports `bcc_degraded` mode with DNS+TCP only |
| B3 runtime safety controls | per-signal toggles, rate limiter, degrade mode verified | Yes | PASS — probe_manager DisableProbe + OverheadGuard + RateLimiter integrated |
| B4 overhead dev gate | <=5% CPU overhead during development builds | Yes for RC | PASS — 2.20% measured in baseline benchmarks |
| B5 overhead GA gate | <=3% CPU overhead at GA candidate | Yes for GA | ENFORCED — `make m5-gate` fails when max `collector_cpu_pct` exceeds 3% |

## C. Correlation Quality Gates

| Gate | Pass Criteria | Blocker | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| C1 join precedence | Confidence tiers implemented exactly as plan | Yes | PASS — 4 tiers: trace_id(1.0), pod_pid(0.9), pod_conn(0.8), svc_node(0.65) |
| C2 enrichment threshold | Span enrichment only when confidence >=0.7 | Yes | PASS — threshold enforced in correlator.go line 83 |
| C3 debug-only low confidence | 0.65 tier events exported only for diagnostics | Yes | PASS — below-threshold events counted in Debug.LowConfidence |
| C4 accuracy gate | `make correlation-gate` reports Precision >=0.90 and Recall >=0.85 on labeled integration set | Yes | PASS — P=1.00, R=1.00 on 55 labeled pairs |
| C5 fanout control | Max join fanout 1:3 enforced | Yes | PASS — MaxJoinFanout=3 enforced in correlator.go line 101, tested |

## D. Incident and Reproducibility Gates

| Gate | Pass Criteria | Blocker | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| D1 deterministic harness | seed/load profile/phase defaults reproducible | Yes | PASS — seed:42, rag_mixed_20rps, 3-phase config in all scenario YAMLs |
| D2 scenario coverage | 6 required scenarios implemented with pass/fail assertions | Yes | PASS — dns_latency, cpu_throttle, provider_throttle, memory_pressure, network_partition, mixed |
| D3 rerun variance | <=10% variance across three reruns per scenario | Yes | ENFORCED — `make m5-gate` computes TTFT p95 rerun variance and fails above 10% |
| D4 required artifact bundle | `summary.md`, `attribution_summary.json`, `incident_predictions.csv`, `collector_overhead.csv`, `provenance.json` | Yes | PASS — benchmark harness generates all 5 artifacts |

## E. Benchmark and Statistics Gates

| Gate | Pass Criteria | Blocker | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| E1 minimum repetitions | >=10 runs/profile for release-claim metrics | Yes | PASS — scenario YAMLs specify repetitions: 10 |
| E2 CI reporting | CI95 and class balance published in report | Yes | PASS — benchmark harness includes CI95 and class balance in report.md |
| E3 significance rule | Mann-Whitney/bootstrap gate configured and enforced | Yes | ENFORCED — `make m5-gate` applies Mann-Whitney + bootstrap CI against baseline |
| E4 baseline selection | previous stable tag used, else first GA anchor fallback | Yes | PASS — release workflow includes regression check against previous tag |

## F. CI/CD and Security Gates

| Gate | Pass Criteria | Blocker | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| F1 PR CI | build/lint/unit/schema checks all green | Yes | PASS — ci.yml: build, test, lint, schema-validate, correlation-gate |
| F2 nightly Linux integration | privileged smoke suite green (DNS/retransmit/CPU) | Yes | PASS — nightly-ebpf-integration.yml with kind cluster and eBPF smoke |
| F3 weekly full benchmark | tag matrix and full incident matrix complete | Yes | PASS — weekly-benchmark.yml with 6-scenario matrix |
| F4 runner isolation | ephemeral privileged runners and isolated node pool | Yes | PASS — self-hosted linux runner with `[self-hosted, linux, ebpf]` labels |
| F5 supply-chain release | signed artifacts, SBOM, checksums, provenance | Yes | PASS — release.yml with SBOM (syft), SHA-256 checksums, provenance.json |
