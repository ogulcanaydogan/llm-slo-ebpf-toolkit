# v0.3 Go/No-Go Checklist

Use this checklist at GA cut.
Decision rule: any blocking gate marked `FAIL` is a `NO-GO`.

## A. Contract and API Gates

| Gate | Pass Criteria | Blocker | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| A1 v1 contract compatibility | No breaking changes in `docs/contracts/v1/*` | Yes | PASS — v1 schemas unchanged; `FaultHypotheses` added as optional array (additive only) |
| A2 v1alpha1 probe schema | `docs/contracts/v1alpha1/probe-event.schema.json` present and validated | Yes | PASS — schema validated by `cmd/schemavalidate` |
| A3 config schema structure | `config/toolkit.schema.json` includes webhook and cdgate sections with proper validation | Yes | PASS — webhook (enabled, url, secret, format, timeout_ms) and cdgate (enabled, prometheus_url, ttft_p95_ms, error_rate, burn_rate, fail_open) sections present |
| A4 semconv consistency | Required `llm.ebpf.*` keys defined for all 9 signals | Yes | PASS — 3 new signal keys (mem_reclaim_latency_ms, disk_io_latency_ms, syscall_latency_ms) added to `pkg/semconv/llm_ebpf.go` and used in correlator |

## B. Signal and Runtime Gates

| Gate | Pass Criteria | Blocker | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| B1 CO-RE signal coverage | 9/9 required signals pass on reference kernels | Yes | PASS — 9 CO-RE probes implemented: dns, tcp_retransmit, runqueue, connect, tls, cpu_steal, mem_reclaim, disk_io, syscall. `TestGeneratorEmitsNewV03Signals` validates 3 new signals |
| B2 fallback capability flagging | BCC mode reports degraded capability explicitly | Yes | PASS — `bcc_fallback.go` reports `bcc_degraded` mode with DNS+TCP only (unchanged from v0.2) |
| B3 runtime safety controls | per-signal toggles, rate limiter, degrade mode verified | Yes | PASS — probe_manager DisableProbe + OverheadGuard + RateLimiter integrated (unchanged from v0.2) |
| B4 overhead dev gate | <=5% CPU overhead during development builds | Yes for RC | PASS — overhead within budget in baseline benchmarks |
| B5 overhead GA gate | <=3% CPU overhead at GA candidate | Yes for GA | ENFORCED — `make m5-gate` fails when node-level p95 or mean `collector_cpu_pct` exceeds 3% |

## C. Correlation Quality Gates

| Gate | Pass Criteria | Blocker | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| C1 join precedence | Confidence tiers implemented exactly as plan | Yes | PASS — 4 tiers: trace_id(1.0), pod_pid(0.9), pod_conn(0.8), svc_node(0.65) |
| C2 enrichment threshold | Span enrichment only when confidence >=0.7 | Yes | PASS — threshold enforced in correlator.go |
| C3 debug-only low confidence | 0.65 tier events exported only for diagnostics | Yes | PASS — below-threshold events counted in Debug.LowConfidence |
| C4 accuracy gate | `make correlation-gate` reports Precision >=0.90 and Recall >=0.85 | Yes | PASS — P=1.00, R=1.00, F1=1.00 on 55 labeled pairs |
| C5 fanout control | Max join fanout 1:3 enforced | Yes | PASS — MaxJoinFanout=3 enforced and tested |

## D. Incident and Reproducibility Gates

| Gate | Pass Criteria | Blocker | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| D1 deterministic harness | seed/load profile/phase defaults reproducible | Yes | PASS — seed:42, rag_mixed_20rps, 3-phase config in all scenario YAMLs |
| D2 scenario coverage | 7 required scenarios implemented with pass/fail assertions | Yes | PASS — dns_latency, cpu_throttle, provider_throttle, memory_pressure, network_partition, mixed, mixed_multi |
| D3 rerun variance | <=10% variance across three reruns per scenario | Yes | ENFORCED — `make m5-gate` computes rerun variance for TTFT p95, tokens p50, and mean error rate |
| D4 required artifact bundle | summary artifacts generated for all scenarios | Yes | PASS — benchmark harness generates attribution_summary.json, confusion-matrix.csv, incident_predictions.csv, collector_overhead.csv, provenance.json, report.md |

## E. Benchmark and Statistics Gates

| Gate | Pass Criteria | Blocker | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| E1 minimum repetitions | >=10 runs/profile for release-claim metrics | Yes | PASS — scenario YAMLs specify repetitions: 10 |
| E2 CI reporting | CI95 and class balance published in report | Yes | PASS — benchmark harness includes CI95 and class balance in report.md |
| E3 significance rule | Mann-Whitney/bootstrap gate configured and enforced | Yes | ENFORCED — `make m5-gate` enforces min sample size, Mann-Whitney p-value, bootstrap CI, and Cliff's delta |
| E4 baseline selection | previous stable tag used, else first GA anchor fallback | Yes | PASS — release workflow includes regression check against previous tag |

## F. CI/CD and Security Gates

| Gate | Pass Criteria | Blocker | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| F1 PR CI | build/lint/unit/schema/helm/webhook/cdgate checks all green | Yes | PASS — ci.yml: build, test, lint, schema-validate, correlation-gate, helm-lint, webhook-smoke, cdgate-smoke, multi-fault-attribution |
| F2 nightly Linux integration | privileged smoke suite green | Yes | PASS — full privileged path active with `ebpf` runner, synthetic fallback for resilience |
| F3 weekly full benchmark | 7-scenario matrix complete (including mixed_multi) | Yes | PASS — full self-hosted 7-scenario matrix active |
| F4 runner isolation | ephemeral privileged runners and isolated node pool | Yes | PASS — t3a.xlarge, 80GB encrypted gp3, SSM-managed, HTTPS-only egress |
| F5 supply-chain release | signed artifacts, SBOM, checksums, provenance, Helm OCI push | Yes | PASS — release.yml with SBOM (syft), SHA-256 checksums, provenance.json, Helm chart packaged and pushed to GHCR OCI |

## G. v0.3 Feature Gates

| Gate | Pass Criteria | Blocker | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| G1 Bayesian attribution | `BayesianAttributor` tested across 8 fault domains with multi-fault hypotheses | Yes | PASS — `TestMultiFaultMultipleHypotheses`, `TestPosteriorsSumToOne`, `TestAttributeSamplePopulatesHypotheses` all pass. 55-sample multi-fault dataset validated |
| G2 Helm chart | Chart.yaml v0.3.0, values.yaml with full config, templates lint and render clean | Yes | PASS — `make helm-lint` passes, `make helm-template` renders valid manifests, 8 templates + test directory |
| G3 Webhook exporter | HMAC-SHA256 signing, exponential retry, PagerDuty + Opsgenie formats tested | Yes | PASS — 7 tests: `TestSendWithHMACSignature`, `TestRetryOn5xx`, `TestFailAfterMaxRetries`, `TestPagerDutyFormat`, `TestOpsgenieFormat`, `TestNoRetryOn4xx`, `TestSendGenericPayload` |
| G4 CD gate | Prometheus SLO query, fail-open semantics, threshold violations tested | Yes | PASS — 8 tests: `TestEvaluateSLOGateAllPass`, `TestEvaluateSLOGateTTFTViolation`, `TestEvaluateSLOGateMultipleViolations`, `TestEvaluateSLOGateQueryError`, `TestHTTPQuerierSuccess`, `TestHTTPQuerierEmptyResult`, `TestHTTPQuerierServerError`, `TestDefaultQueriesHaveAllMetrics` |
| G5 Multi-fault dataset | 55 labeled samples covering single, dual, triple fault combinations | Yes | PASS — `pkg/attribution/testdata/multi_fault_samples.jsonl` with 55 samples, PartialAccuracy + CoverageAccuracy metrics computed |
| G6 Version flag | All 11 CLI binaries support `--version` with ldflags injection | Yes | PASS — `var version = "dev"` in all 11 cmd/*/main.go, release.yml passes `-X main.version=${{ github.ref_name }}` |
